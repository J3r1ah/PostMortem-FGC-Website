#PostMortem FGC



# About Us
The Vision for this website is to chat with people in the FGC community, talk crap and play against each other to see who is better because why not.

You can host tournaments and specific matches with a specified set number of how many times you fight them. You record those matches and submit them to the site for scheduled publicity.

website also holds news for popular fighting games and everything around it such as big tournaments, game updates and updates on professional players and their insight.

You will be able to make an account and record your matches, characters you use and win rate.
You also have to chat and give feedback with the person after the match so everyone learns everyone doesn't hate each other and everyone continues playing.
