    What is PostMortem FGC
  <p>___________________________________________</p>
  </h1>

  <p>The Vision for this website is to chat with people in the FGC community, 
    talk crap and play against each other to see who is better because why not.</p>

 <p> You can host tournaments and specific matches with a specified set number of how many times you fight them. 
   You record those matches and submit them to the site for scheduled publicity.</p>

  <P> website also holds news for popular fighting games and everything around it such as big tournaments, game updates and updates on professional players and their insight.</P>

</p>You will be able to make an account and record your matches, characters you use and win rate. </p>

  <p>You also have to chat and give feedback with the person after the match so everyone learns everyone doesn't hate each other and everyone continues playing.</p>

  <p>currently its. in beta due to my current inability and knowlege on how to make what i want. So this is the extent of the knowlege i have on making. what i want on website </p>
